# Anagrams

## What is this?

`anagrams.py` is a program that inputs the path to a text or csv file containing one word for each line. It then finds all the one-worded anagrams within the file and prints them.

## Requirements

The only requirement to run this program is to have Python 3.x installed.

## How to run the program

Specify the filepath given to the call to the `main()` function, or leave it as it is to read from the `eventyr.txt` file in the project folder.

Run the program by running the command

```console
$ python anagrams.py
```

from the root folder.
