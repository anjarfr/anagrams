# Anagrams

## What is this?
A program that inputs a filename of a file containing words, and outputs all one-word-anagrams within the file.

## Requirements
The only requirement to run this program is to have Python 3.x installed.

## How to run the program
Specify a filename given to the `main()` function, or leave it as it is to read from the `eventyr.txt` file in the project folder.

Run the program by running the command

```console
$ python anagrams.py
```

from the root folder.
